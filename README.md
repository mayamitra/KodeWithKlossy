# Kode With Klossy Application

## Hi! My name is Maya Mitrasinovic. 

In this repository, I have included my final project from the Processing course I took last semester, as well as homework assignments from the Python course I am currently taking.

My Processing final project is a game in which two players throw fire balls at each other, with the score decreasing each time a player gets hit, until one player's score gets to zero. It uses object-oriented programming, with a class for the characters, player 1's fireball, player 2's fireball, and the background stars. Array lists, arrays, and single instances are used for the different classes. Also, I have imported two different sound libraries and use two files: one for background music, and one for sound effects. 

I have included two Python assignments. PSet 1 includes work with variable assessment, string indexing, functions, and if/else statements. PSet 2 includes work with looping, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
